# Development of an Augmented Reality System to Assist Billiard Players Using the Microsoft Hololens

4 months research project at the Computer Science Department of the University of Otago, New-Zealand. 

In this project, we propose an augmented reality billiard system, which aims at improving
billiard playersâ€™ performance. The augmented reality is performed through the Microsoft
Hololens.

The application was based on the Microsoft sample HololendForCV aimed at making it easier to use HoloLens
as a tool for Computer Vision and Robotics research.Our contribution was first to implement Image processing algorithms such as Pool Table detection and
Ball detection. Then, it was to improve the holographic rendering.
